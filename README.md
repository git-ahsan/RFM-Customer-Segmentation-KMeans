## 🎯 Project Objective
📊 To understand customer purchase behavior using historical transaction data.

👥 To calculate RFM metrics and use them to cluster customers into distinct segments.

💎 To identify high-value customers and offer actionable insights for business decision-making.

📈 To visualize the clustering results and support data-driven marketing strategies.

## 📊 Dataset Description

📁 CSV File: [Retail Customer Data]

The dataset used in this project is a **retail transaction dataset** containing historical sales data from an online retailer between **December 1, 2009** and **December 9, 2010**.

Key characteristics:

- **Total Records:** ~500,000 transactions
- **File Name:** [Retail Customer Data 2009-10.csv](https://github.com/git-ahsan/RFM-Customer-Segmentation-KMeans/blob/main/Retail%20Customer%20Data%202009-10.zip)
- **Format:** CSV

|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Invoice No`     | Unique identifier for each transaction                                      |
| `Stock Code`     | Product (item) code                                                         |
| `Product Description`   | Product name                                                                |
| `Quantity`      | The number of items purchased per transaction                               |
| `Invoice Date`   | Date and time when the invoice was generated                                |
| `Unit Price`     | Price per unit of the product                                               |
| `Customer ID`    | Unique customer identifier                                                  |
| `Country`       | Country name where the customer resides                                     |

> 🛠️ Note: Rows with missing `CustomerID` were dropped to ensure clean customer segmentation.

From this dataset, **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** features were derived to perform customer segmentation analysis using clustering techniques.

## 📈 Methodology / Workflow

This project follows a structured pipeline to perform customer segmentation using RFM analysis and KMeans clustering:

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Importing Required Libraries

In this step, we import all the essential Python libraries and modules required for data loading, analysis, visualization, and clustering.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from yellowbrick.cluster import KElbowVisualizer
```

### 🔹 Step 2: Load and Inspect the Dataset

The dataset is loaded using `pandas.read_csv()` with appropriate encoding to handle special characters. Initial inspection is done to understand the structure and shape of the data.

```python
df = pd.read_csv("Retail Customer Data 2009-10.csv", encoding='unicode_escape')
df
```

### 🔹 Step 3: Check Data Types of Each Column

Before performing any transformation or analysis, it's important to understand the data types of each column in the dataset. This ensures the right operations are applied to each feature.

```python
df.dtypes
```

### 🔹 Step 4: Convert Invoice Date and Set Reference Date

To prepare for RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, we must ensure the `Invoice Date` column is in datetime format. We also set a fixed reference date (`CurrentDate`) to calculate **Recency** later on.

###### Used .tail() to inspect the last few transactions
```python
df.tail(5)
```

###### Set a custom Current Date to calculate how recently each customer made a purchase
```python
CurrentDate = pd.to_datetime("2011-01-01")
CurrentDate
```

###### Converted Invoice Date from object to datetime64[ns] using pd.to_datetime(). Then Verified the conversion using .dtypes.
```python
df["Invoice Date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["Invoice Date"])
df.dtypes
```

### 🔹 Step 5: Identify and Remove Missing Customer IDs

Before performing RFM analysis, we must remove incomplete records. Customer ID is critical for segmentation, so entries without it are excluded.

###### At first checked initial dataset shape using .shape
```python
df.shape
```

###### Identified missing values in all columns using .isnull().sum(), where Found that some records had missing Customer ID and Product Description.
```python
df.isnull().sum()
```

###### Removed only those Customer ID records using dropna() and Re-checked dataset shape to confirm the number of valid entries
```python
df = df.dropna(subset=["Customer ID"])
df.shape
```

### 🔹 Step 6: Calculate `Recency` – Days Since Last Purchase

Recency refers to how recently a customer made a purchase. In this step, we calculate the number of days since each customer's last transaction based on a fixed reference date.

###### Grouped data by `Customer ID` and extracted the most recent `Invoice Date`
```python
Lastrnxdate = df.groupby(["Customer ID"]).max()[["Invoice Date"]]
Lastrnxdate
```

###### Calculated `Invoice Age` by subtracting the last purchase date from the `CurrentDate`
```python
Lastrnxdate["Invoice Age"] = (CurrentDate - Lastrnxdate["Invoice Date"]).dt.days
Lastrnxdate
```

###### Drop `Invoice Date` and Renamed the result as `Recency`, which represents the number of days since a customer's last transaction
```python
Recency = Lastrnxdate.drop("Invoice Date", axis=1)
```
