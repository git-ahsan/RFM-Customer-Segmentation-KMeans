# Retail Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis and KMeans Clustering

## üìÑ 1. Project Summary

This project focuses on **Retail Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis and KMeans Clustering** to identify valuable customer groups and enable targeted marketing strategies.

Using historical retail transaction data, customers were segmented based on their:

- **Recency** ‚Äì How recently a customer made a purchase  
- **Frequency** ‚Äì How often a customer makes purchases  
- **Monetary** ‚Äì How much money a customer spends

By applying the **RFM model** and clustering techniques, we discovered hidden patterns in customer behavior and classified them into distinct segments like **Diamond, Gold, Silver, and Bronze**. These insights help businesses:

- Personalize customer experiences
- Retain high-value customers
- Reactivate inactive users
- Optimize marketing resources

üìä This end-to-end project demonstrates a practical application of data science to solve real-world business challenges using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and visual storytelling with Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## üìà 5. Methodology / Workflow

This project follows a structured pipeline to perform customer segmentation using RFM analysis and KMeans clustering:

### üîπ Step 1: Importing Required Libraries

In this step, we import all the essential Python libraries and modules required for data loading, analysis, visualization, and clustering.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from yellowbrick.cluster import KElbowVisualizer
```

### üîπ Step 2: Load and Inspect the Dataset

The dataset is loaded using `pandas.read_csv()` with appropriate encoding to handle special characters. Initial inspection is done to understand the structure and shape of the data.

```python
df = pd.read_csv("Retail Customer Data 2009-10.csv", encoding='unicode_escape')
df
```

### üîπ Step 3: Check Data Types of Each Column

Before performing any transformation or analysis, it's important to understand the data types of each column in the dataset. This ensures the right operations are applied to each feature.

```python
df.dtypes
```

### üîπ Step 4: Convert Invoice Date and Set Reference Date

To prepare for RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, we must ensure the `Invoice Date` column is in datetime format. We also set a fixed reference date (`CurrentDate`) to calculate **Recency** later on.

###### Used .tail() to inspect the last few transactions
```python
df.tail(5)
```

###### Set a custom Current Date to calculate how recently each customer made a purchase
```python
CurrentDate = pd.to_datetime("2011-01-01")
CurrentDate
```

###### Converted Invoice Date from object to datetime64[ns] using pd.to_datetime(). Then Verified the conversion using .dtypes.
```python
df["Invoice Date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["Invoice Date"])
df.dtypes
```

### üîπ Step 5: Identify and Remove Missing Customer IDs

Before performing RFM analysis, we must remove incomplete records. Customer ID is critical for segmentation, so entries without it are excluded.

###### At first checked initial dataset shape using .shape
```python
df.shape
```

###### Identified missing values in all columns using .isnull().sum(), where Found that some records had missing Customer ID and Product Description.
```python
df.isnull().sum()
```

###### Two records contained null values in the `Customer ID` and `Product Description` fields. Since `Customer ID` is essential for customer-level analysis, only those rows with missing `Customer ID` were removed using `dropna()`. The dataset shape was then re-checked to confirm the number of valid entries.
```python
df = df.dropna(subset=["Customer ID"])
df.shape
```

### üîπ Step 6: Calculate `Recency` ‚Äì Days Since Last Purchase

Recency refers to how recently a customer made a purchase. In this step, we calculate the number of days since each customer's last transaction based on a fixed reference date.

###### Grouped data by `Customer ID` and extracted the most recent `Invoice Date`
```python
Lastrnxdate = df.groupby(["Customer ID"]).max()[["Invoice Date"]]
Lastrnxdate
```

###### Calculated `Invoice Age` by subtracting the last purchase date from the `CurrentDate`
```python
Lastrnxdate["Invoice Age"] = (CurrentDate - Lastrnxdate["Invoice Date"]).dt.days
Lastrnxdate
```

###### Drop `Invoice Date` and Renamed the result as `Recency`, which represents the number of days since a customer's last transaction
```python
Recency = Lastrnxdate.drop("Invoice Date", axis=1)
```

### üîπ Step 7: Calculate Frequency ‚Äì Number of Purchases

Frequency indicates how many times a customer made a purchase. To avoid counting the same invoice multiple times, we use unique invoice numbers for each customer.

###### At First Checked the original dataset
```python
df
```

###### Grouped by Customer ID and counted the number of unique invoices per customer
```python
UniqueInvoice = df.drop_duplicates(subset="Invoice No")
UniqueInvoice
```

###### Grouped by `Customer ID` to count the number of unique invoices and create the `Frequency` DataFrame representing each customer's total purchases.
```python
Frequency = UniqueInvoice.groupby(["Customer ID"]).count()[["Invoice No"]]
Frequency
```

### üîπ Step 8: Calculate Monetary ‚Äì Total Amount Spent

Monetary refers to the total amount a customer has spent. This step involves calculating the transaction value per row and summing it by customer.

###### Ensures we're working with a safe, independent copy of the DataFrame. This avoids the `SettingWithCopyWarning` from pandas when modifying a sliced DataFrame.
```python
df = df.copy()
```

###### Calculates the `Monetary` value of each transaction and stores it in a new column called "Total".
```python
df.loc[:, "Total"] = df["Quantity"] * df["Unit Price"]
```

###### Grouped by `Customer ID` and summed up the "Total" column to create the Monetary DataFrame. This gives the total spending per customer across all their purchases.
```python
Monetary = df.groupby(["Customer ID"])[["Total"]].sum()
Monetary
```

### üîπ Step 9: Combine Recency, Frequency, and Monetary into RFM Table

After calculating the three individual metrics, we combine them into a single DataFrame for customer segmentation analysis.

###### Used pd.concat() to join the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary DataFrames side-by-side
```python
RFM = pd.concat([Recency, Frequency, Monetary], axis=1)
```

###### Renamed columns for clarity and standard naming convention
```python
RFM.columns = ['Recency', 'Frequency', 'Monetary']
RFM
```

### üîπ Step 10: Scale the RFM Features for Clustering

Before applying KMeans clustering, it's essential to standardize the RFM values to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the distance calculations.
This step utilizes `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing` to perform the scaling.

RFM features have different units and value ranges (e.g., Recency in days, Monetary in currency). If left unscaled, features with larger numerical ranges would dominate the clustering process. Since KMeans relies on Euclidean distance to group data points, this could bias the results.

Standardization solves this issue by transforming all features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, allowing for fair and balanced clustering.

```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled = scaler.fit_transform(RFM)
scaled
scaled.shape
```

### üîπ Step 11: Determine Optimal k Using the Elbow Method

To find the ideal number of customer segments (clusters), I use the **Elbow Method**, which plots the **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)** against a range of possible `k` values. The point where the SSE curve starts to flatten (like an elbow) is considered the optimal value of `k`.
This step utilizes `KMeans` from `sklearn.cluster`.

```python
k_range = range(2, 11)
sse = []  # Sum of Squared Errors

for k in k_range:
    km = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42)
    km.fit(scaled)
    sse.append(km.inertia_)
sse
```

### üîπ Step 12: Visualize Elbow Curve Using Matplotlib

Before applying `KElbowVisualizer`, I plotted the Elbow Curve manually using `matplotlib.pyplot` to get a clear visual of how the **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)** changes with different `k` values.

```python
fig, axes = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,6), facecolor="#E6F9FA")

axes.plot(
    k_range, sse,
    color="purple",
    lw=3,
    ls='--',
    marker='s',
    markersize=8,
    markerfacecolor="yellow",
    markeredgewidth=3,
    markeredgecolor="red"
)

plt.grid(True, linestyle='--', alpha=0.8)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### üîπ Step 13: Visualize Optimal k Using KElbowVisualizer (Yellowbrick)

To complement the manual elbow plot, I used **Yellowbrick's KElbowVisualizer** to automatically identify the optimal number of clusters (`k`) based on **distortion (SSE)**. 
This step utilizes both `KElbowVisualizer` from `yellowbrick.cluster` and `KMeans` from `sklearn.cluster` to perform the visualizer.

```python
model = KMeans(random_state=42)
elbow = KElbowVisualizer(
    model,
    k=(2, 10),
    metric='distortion',
    timings=True,           # Shows training time per k
    locate_elbow=True,      # Automatically marks the elbow point
    size=(700, 500)         # Resize the plot
)

elbow.fit(scaled)
elbow.show()
```

### üîπ Step 14: Fit KMeans Model with Optimal Number of Clusters-k

The KMeans model was instantiated with 4 clusters, reflecting the elbow analysis. A `random_state of 42` was set to ensure consistent results across all executions. The model was then trained on the scaled RFM data to delineate distinct customer segments.

```python
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(scaled)
```

### üîπ Step 15: Assign Cluster Labels to Customers

After training the final KMeans model, I assigned each customer to a cluster by attaching the predicted labels to the RFM table.

###### Used kmeans.labels_ to extract cluster predictions for each customer.
```python
kmeans.labels_
```

###### Verified the number of labels matched the number of customers.
```python
kmeans.labels_.shape
```

###### Added a new column `Clusters` to the RFM DataFrame to store the segment each customer belongs to.
```python
RFM["Clusters"] = kmeans.labels_  # Assign labels to RFM table
RFM
```

###### Checked the distinct cluster labels (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3)
```python
RFM.Clusters.unique()
```

### üîπ Step 16: Visualize Customer Segments in 3D (RFM Clusters)

To better understand the distribution of customer clusters, a 3D scatter plot was generated to visualize customer clusters based on their **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary** (RFM) values. This plot, created using matplotlib's 3D projection, maps Recency to the X-axis, Frequency to the Y-axis, and Monetary to the Z-axis. Each customer cluster is differentiated by color using the "Accent" colormap, allowing for a clear visual separation of segments across all three RFM dimensions. The axes are labeled and a grid is enabled to enhance readability, ultimately helping to validate the quality of the customer clustering.

```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 9), facecolor="#E6F9FA")   ###Creates Matplotlib figure with a light background.
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d', label="bla")  ###adds a 3D subplot to the figure.

###creates a 3D scatter plot of RFM data.
scatter = ax.scatter(
    RFM["Recency"], 
    RFM["Frequency"], 
    RFM["Monetary"], 
    c=RFM["Clusters"], 
    cmap="Accent", 
    s=60, 
    edgecolor='k', 
    alpha=0.8
)

###Titles and labels the 3D plot axes.
ax.set_title("3D Clustering of Customers (RFM)", fontsize=16, fontweight='bold')
ax.set_xlabel("Recency", fontsize=12, fontweight='bold')
ax.set_ylabel("Frequency", fontsize=12, fontweight='bold')
ax.set_zlabel("Monetary", fontsize=12, fontweight='bold')
ax.grid(True)            #Titles and labels the 3D plot axes.

plt.show()
```

### üîπ Step 17: Analyze and Profile Each Customer Cluster

After clustering, each segment is analyzed to uncover customer behavior patterns based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values. By filtering the RFM dataset for each cluster (0, 1, 2, 3), distinct profiles can be identified ‚Äî such as customers with low recency and high monetary value (likely loyal or VIPs), those with high recency and low frequency (possibly inactive or at-risk), and others with moderate values (average or developing customers). This interpretation helps transform raw clusters into meaningful business personas for data-driven marketing strategies.

```python
RFM[RFM.Clusters == 0]
RFM[RFM.Clusters == 1]
RFM[RFM.Clusters == 2]
RFM[RFM.Clusters == 3]
```

### üîπ Step 18: Summarize RFM Metrics by Cluster

To better understand each customer segment, the average Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values were calculated for every cluster. This aggregated view reveals the overall behavior of each group ‚Äî such as how recently customers purchased, how often they buy, and how much they typically spend. These cluster-wise summaries serve as the foundation for assigning intuitive labels like ‚ÄúVIP,‚Äù ‚ÄúAt-Risk,‚Äù or ‚ÄúPotential Loyalists,‚Äù making the segmentation actionable for strategic business decisions.

```python
final = RFM.groupby("Clusters").mean()[["Recency", "Frequency", "Monetary"]]
final
```

### üîπ Step 19: Assign Descriptive Labels to Customer Segments

To make the cluster segments more interpretable for business users, numeric cluster labels were mapped to descriptive names ‚Äî such as ‚ÄúDiamond,‚Äù ‚ÄúGold,‚Äù ‚ÄúSilver,‚Äù and ‚ÄúBronze‚Äù ‚Äî based on their average RFM scores. A custom function was applied row-wise to assign each customer to a group, enabling clearer communication of customer value and facilitating targeted marketing strategies aligned with each segment‚Äôs behavior.

```python
def func(row):
    if row["Clusters"] == 2:
        return 'Diamond'
    elif row["Clusters"] == 3:
        return 'Gold'
    elif row["Clusters"] == 0:
        return 'Silver'
    else:
        return 'Bronze'

RFM['Group'] = RFM.apply(func, axis=1)
RFM
```

### üîπ Step 20: Count Customers in Each Segment

To understand how customers are distributed across the defined segments, the number of customers in each group (Diamond, Gold, Silver, Bronze) was calculated using value_counts(). The result was converted into a DataFrame and reset with a new index, making it suitable for reporting, visualization, and further analysis. This summary helps evaluate which segments are dominant and where targeted marketing or improvement strategies should focus.

```python
result = pd.DataFrame(RFM.Group.value_counts())
result = result.reset_index()
result
```

### üîπ Step 21: Visualize Customer Segmentation Results

To visually represent the results of customer segmentation, a combined chart was created using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The bar chart (on a log scale) shows the absolute count of customers per group, while the donut chart displays the percentage share of each segment. Custom colors and annotations were applied for clarity and visual appeal. Together, these charts provide a clear, interpretable overview of how customers are distributed across the Diamond, Gold, Silver, and Bronze segments.

```python
Group = result["Group"]
Count = result["count"]
Customcolors = ["#81DED0", "#FA667E", "#FED315", "#461856"]

# Create a figure with two subplots
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14, 6))

# Bar Chart
sns.barplot(x=Group, y=Count, hue=Group, palette=Customcolors, ax=ax1, legend=False)
ax1.set_yscale('log')
ax1.set_title("Bar Chart (Log Scale)", fontsize=16, fontweight='bold')
ax1.set_xlabel("Customer Group", fontsize=12, fontweight='bold')
ax1.set_ylabel("Log Count", fontsize=12, fontweight='bold')

for container in ax1.containers:
    ax1.bar_label(container, fontsize=10, fontweight='bold')

# Donut (Pie) Chart
wedges, texts, autotexts = ax2.pie(
    Count,
    labels=Group,
    colors=Customcolors,
    autopct='%1.1f%%',
    startangle=0,
    wedgeprops=dict(width=0.6)
)
ax2.set_title("Donut Chart (Percentage)", fontsize=16, fontweight='bold')
plt.setp(autotexts, size=10, weight="bold", color="Black")

plt.suptitle("Customer Group Distribution Analysis", fontsize=20, fontweight='bold', color='navy')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### üîπ Step 22: Deep Dive into Diamond Segment (Cluster 2)

To gain more insight into the high-value Diamond segment (Cluster 2), the dataset was filtered to explore customers at the two extremes of spending. This helped identify the highest spender and the least active spender within the group. Such outlier analysis can be valuable for personalized engagement strategies, loyalty programs, or even fraud checks in real-world applications.

```python
ABC = RFM[RFM.Clusters == 2]

# Identify customer with the lowest spending in the Diamond group
ABC[ABC['Monetary'] == ABC['Monetary'].min()]

# Identify customer with the highest spending in the Diamond group
ABC[ABC['Monetary'] == ABC['Monetary'].max()]
```

### üîπ Step 23: Extract Customers from Diamond Segment

To prepare for targeted marketing or personalized campaigns, the dataset was filtered to extract all customers assigned to the ‚ÄúDiamond‚Äù segment ‚Äî those with the most frequent, recent, and high-spending behaviors. This subset represents the business‚Äôs top-tier customers and can be used for loyalty programs, VIP offers, or high-priority retention strategies.

```python
diamond_customers = RFM[RFM["Group"] == "Diamond"]
diamond_customers
```

### üîπ Step 24: Normalize Diamond Segment RFM Values

To prepare the Diamond segment data for consistent comparison and visualization, the RFM values were scaled between 0 and 1 using **MinMaxScaler** from `sklearn.preprocessing`. This ensures that each feature (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) contributes equally and is not skewed by differing ranges. Normalization is especially useful before plotting radar charts or when feeding the data into models or scoring systems that require uniform feature scales.

```python
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
normalized = scaler.fit_transform(diamond_customers[["Recency", "Frequency", "Monetary"]])
normalized
```

### üîπ Step 25: Create DataFrame for Normalized RFM Values

The normalized RFM values for Diamond customers were converted into a new DataFrame named `diamond_normalized`, with appropriate column names and original customer indices preserved. This structure makes it easy to analyze, visualize, or merge with other data sources for deeper insights or targeted actions on high-value customers.

```python
diamond_normalized = pd.DataFrame(normalized, columns=["Recency_N", "Frequency_N", "Monetary_N"], index=diamond_customers.index)
diamond_normalized
```

### Step 26: Calculate Weighted Score for Diamond Customers  
To prioritize customers within the high-value Diamond segment, we computed a weighted score using normalized RFM values. Recency was inverted (lower values = better) and custom weights were applied:  
- **30% Recency** (prioritizing recent purchases),  
- **20% Frequency** (moderate emphasis on loyalty),  
- **50% Monetary** (maximum focus on spending behavior).  

This optimized weighting identifies top-tier Diamond customers for exclusive campaigns, balancing revenue potential with engagement.  

```python
diamond_customers = diamond_customers.copy()

diamond_customers["Score"] = (
    (1 - diamond_normalized["Recency_N"]) * 0.30 +  # Inverted for lower=better
    diamond_normalized["Frequency_N"] * 0.20 +
    diamond_normalized["Monetary_N"] * 0.50
)
```

### üîπ Step 27: Rank Diamond Customers by Score

To finalize the prioritization of customers in the Diamond segment, a ranking column was added based on the calculated Score. Customers were ranked in descending order, with rank 1 representing the most valuable individual in the group. This ranking enables targeted engagement, top-tier reward programs, or focused retention efforts on the highest contributors.

```python
diamond_customers["Diamond_Rank"] = diamond_customers["Score"].rank(ascending=False).astype(int)
```

### üîπ Step 28: Sort Diamond Customers by Rank

The `diamond_customers` DataFrame was sorted in ascending order by the `Diamond_Rank` column to place the **most valuable customers at the top**. This final view enables easy extraction of the top-tier customers for exclusive targeting, strategic engagement, or exporting to external tools like Power BI or CRM systems.

```python
diamond_customers_sorted = diamond_customers.sort_values("Diamond_Rank")
diamond_customers_sorted
```

### üîπ Step 29: Final View of Ranked Diamond Customers

Displayed a clean, focused summary of the ranked Diamond customers, showing each customer‚Äôs priority rank, calculated score, and original RFM metrics. This final view enables stakeholders to quickly identify and understand the top-performing customers, making it ideal for reporting, executive dashboards, or direct action via marketing or loyalty initiatives.

```python
diamond_customers_sorted[["Diamond_Rank", "Score", "Recency", "Frequency", "Monetary"]]
```

### üîπ Step 30: Visualize Ranked Diamond Customers with Score and ID

A bar chart was created to visually rank Diamond customers based on their composite RFM scores. Each bar represents a customer‚Äôs score, with the Customer ID displayed above the bar for easy identification. This plot offers a quick, intuitive overview of the top-tier customers and can be used in presentations, dashboards, or performance tracking reports to communicate which customers contribute the most value to the business.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Prepare the figure
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6), facecolor="#F7FAFC")

Rank = diamond_customers_sorted["Diamond_Rank"]
Score = diamond_customers_sorted["Score"]

# Create barplot
barplot = sns.barplot(
    x=Rank,
    y=Score,
    hue=Rank,
    palette="viridis",
    legend=False
)

# Add Customer ID labels on top of bars
for index, row in diamond_customers_sorted.iterrows():
    barplot.text(
        x=row["Diamond_Rank"] - 1,
        y=row["Score"] + 0.01,
        s=str(index),
        ha='center',
        fontsize=10,
        fontweight='bold',
        color='black'
    )

# Styling
plt.title("Diamond Customers Ranked by Composite RFM Score", fontsize=16, fontweight='bold', color='navy')
plt.xlabel("Customer Rank", fontsize=12, fontweight='bold')
plt.ylabel("Score", fontsize=12, fontweight='bold')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## 6. üìä Results & Visualizations

After performing RFM analysis and clustering using KMeans, we identified **4 distinct customer segments**: üü£ Diamond, üü° Gold, üîò Silver, and üî¥ Bronze. Each segment represents different behavioral patterns based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value.

### üß© Segment Distribution:
- A **bar chart (log scale)** and a **donut chart** were used to illustrate the number and percentage of customers in each group.
- This helped identify which customer groups are the most dominant and which require attention.

### üíé Diamond Segment (High Value):
- A deep dive was conducted into the **Diamond cluster**, including normalization and a custom **RFM-based scoring system**.
- Each Diamond customer was **ranked** based on their behavior using a weighted score (Recency: 25%, Frequency: 25%, Monetary: 50%).

### üìà Visualizations:
- ‚úÖ **Customer Segment Distribution** (Bar & Donut)
- ‚úÖ **3D Cluster Plot** using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary
