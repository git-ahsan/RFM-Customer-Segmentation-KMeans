## üìà Methodology / Workflow

This project follows a structured pipeline to perform customer segmentation using RFM analysis and KMeans clustering:

---

### üîπ Step 1: Importing Required Libraries

In this step, we import all the essential Python libraries and modules required for data loading, analysis, visualization, and clustering.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from yellowbrick.cluster import KElbowVisualizer
```

### üîπ Step 2: Load and Inspect the Dataset

The dataset is loaded using `pandas.read_csv()` with appropriate encoding to handle special characters. Initial inspection is done to understand the structure and shape of the data.

```python
df = pd.read_csv("Retail Customer Data 2009-10.csv", encoding='unicode_escape')
df
```

### üîπ Step 3: Check Data Types of Each Column

Before performing any transformation or analysis, it's important to understand the data types of each column in the dataset. This ensures the right operations are applied to each feature.

```python
df.dtypes
```

### üîπ Step 4: Convert Invoice Date and Set Reference Date

To prepare for RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, we must ensure the `Invoice Date` column is in datetime format. We also set a fixed reference date (`CurrentDate`) to calculate **Recency** later on.

###### Used .tail() to inspect the last few transactions
```python
df.tail(5)
```

###### Set a custom Current Date to calculate how recently each customer made a purchase
```python
CurrentDate = pd.to_datetime("2011-01-01")
CurrentDate
```

###### Converted Invoice Date from object to datetime64[ns] using pd.to_datetime(). Then Verified the conversion using .dtypes.
```python
df["Invoice Date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["Invoice Date"])
df.dtypes
```

### üîπ Step 5: Identify and Remove Missing Customer IDs

Before performing RFM analysis, we must remove incomplete records. Customer ID is critical for segmentation, so entries without it are excluded.

###### At first checked initial dataset shape using .shape
```python
df.shape
```

###### Identified missing values in all columns using .isnull().sum(), where Found that some records had missing Customer ID and Product Description.
```python
df.isnull().sum()
```

###### Removed only those Customer ID records using dropna() and Re-checked dataset shape to confirm the number of valid entries
```python
df = df.dropna(subset=["Customer ID"])
df.shape
```

### üîπ Step 6: Calculate `Recency` ‚Äì Days Since Last Purchase

Recency refers to how recently a customer made a purchase. In this step, we calculate the number of days since each customer's last transaction based on a fixed reference date.

###### Grouped data by `Customer ID` and extracted the most recent `Invoice Date`
```python
Lastrnxdate = df.groupby(["Customer ID"]).max()[["Invoice Date"]]
Lastrnxdate
```

###### Calculated `Invoice Age` by subtracting the last purchase date from the `CurrentDate`
```python
Lastrnxdate["Invoice Age"] = (CurrentDate - Lastrnxdate["Invoice Date"]).dt.days
Lastrnxdate
```

###### Drop `Invoice Date` and Renamed the result as `Recency`, which represents the number of days since a customer's last transaction
```python
Recency = Lastrnxdate.drop("Invoice Date", axis=1)
```

### üîπ Step 7: Calculate Frequency ‚Äì Number of Purchases

Frequency indicates how many times a customer made a purchase. To avoid counting the same invoice multiple times, we use unique invoice numbers for each customer.

###### At First Checked the original dataset
```python
df
```

###### Grouped by Customer ID and counted the number of unique invoices per customer
```python
UniqueInvoice = df.drop_duplicates(subset="Invoice No")
UniqueInvoice
```

###### Grouped by `Customer ID` to count the number of unique invoices and create the `Frequency` DataFrame representing each customer's total purchases.
```python
Frequency = UniqueInvoice.groupby(["Customer ID"]).count()[["Invoice No"]]
Frequency
```

### üîπ Step 8: Calculate Monetary ‚Äì Total Amount Spent

Monetary refers to the total amount a customer has spent. This step involves calculating the transaction value per row and summing it by customer.

###### Ensures we're working with a safe, independent copy of the DataFrame. This avoids the `SettingWithCopyWarning` from pandas when modifying a sliced DataFrame.
```python
df = df.copy()
```

###### Calculates the `Monetary` value of each transaction and stores it in a new column called "Total".
```python
df.loc[:, "Total"] = df["Quantity"] * df["Unit Price"]
```

###### Grouped by `Customer ID` and summed up the "Total" column to create the Monetary DataFrame. This gives the total spending per customer across all their purchases.
```python
Monetary = df.groupby(["Customer ID"])[["Total"]].sum()
Monetary
```

### üîπ Step 9: Combine Recency, Frequency, and Monetary into RFM Table

After calculating the three individual metrics, we combine them into a single DataFrame for customer segmentation analysis.

###### Used pd.concat() to join the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary DataFrames side-by-side
```python
RFM = pd.concat([Recency, Frequency, Monetary], axis=1)
```

###### Renamed columns for clarity and standard naming convention
```python
RFM.columns = ['Recency', 'Frequency', 'Monetary']
RFM
```

### üîπ Step 10: Scale the RFM Features for Clustering

Before applying KMeans clustering, it's essential to standardize the RFM values to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the distance calculations.
This step utilizes `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing` to perform the scaling.

RFM features have different units and value ranges (e.g., Recency in days, Monetary in currency). If left unscaled, features with larger numerical ranges would dominate the clustering process. Since KMeans relies on Euclidean distance to group data points, this could bias the results.

Standardization solves this issue by transforming all features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, allowing for fair and balanced clustering.

```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled = scaler.fit_transform(RFM)
scaled
scaled.shape
```

### üîπ Step 11: Determine Optimal k Using the Elbow Method

To find the ideal number of customer segments (clusters), I use the **Elbow Method**, which plots the **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)** against a range of possible `k` values. The point where the SSE curve starts to flatten (like an elbow) is considered the optimal value of `k`.
This step utilizes `KMeans` from `sklearn.cluster`.

```python
k_range = range(2, 11)
sse = []  # Sum of Squared Errors

for k in k_range:
    km = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42)
    km.fit(scaled)
    sse.append(km.inertia_)
sse
```

### üîπ Step 12: Visualize Elbow Curve Using Matplotlib

Before applying `KElbowVisualizer`, I plotted the Elbow Curve manually using `matplotlib.pyplot` to get a clear visual of how the **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)** changes with different `k` values.

```python
fig, axes = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,6), facecolor="#E6F9FA")

axes.plot(
    k_range, sse,
    color="purple",
    lw=3,
    ls='--',
    marker='s',
    markersize=8,
    markerfacecolor="yellow",
    markeredgewidth=3,
    markeredgecolor="red"
)

plt.grid(True, linestyle='--', alpha=0.8)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### üîπ Step 13: Visualize Optimal k Using KElbowVisualizer (Yellowbrick)

To complement the manual elbow plot, I used **Yellowbrick's KElbowVisualizer** to automatically identify the optimal number of clusters (`k`) based on **distortion (SSE)**. 
This step utilizes both `KElbowVisualizer` from `yellowbrick.cluster` and `KMeans` from `sklearn.cluster` to perform the visualizer.

```python
model = KMeans(random_state=42)
elbow = KElbowVisualizer(
    model,
    k=(2, 10),
    metric='distortion',
    timings=True,           # Shows training time per k
    locate_elbow=True,      # Automatically marks the elbow point
    size=(700, 500)         # Resize the plot
)

elbow.fit(scaled)
elbow.show()
```

### üîπ Step 14: Fit KMeans Model with Optimal Number of Clusters-k

The KMeans model was instantiated with 4 clusters, reflecting the elbow analysis. A `random_state of 42` was set to ensure consistent results across all executions. The model was then trained on the scaled RFM data to delineate distinct customer segments.

```python
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(scaled)
```

### üîπ Step 15: Assign Cluster Labels to Customers

After training the final KMeans model, I assigned each customer to a cluster by attaching the predicted labels to the RFM table.

###### Used kmeans.labels_ to extract cluster predictions for each customer.
```python
kmeans.labels_
```

###### Verified the number of labels matched the number of customers.
```python
kmeans.labels_.shape
```

###### Added a new column `Clusters` to the RFM DataFrame to store the segment each customer belongs to.
```python
RFM["Clusters"] = kmeans.labels_  # Assign labels to RFM table
RFM
```

###### Checked the distinct cluster labels (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3)
```python
RFM.Clusters.unique()
```

### üîπ Step 16: Visualize Customer Segments in 3D (RFM Clusters)

To better understand the distribution of customer clusters, a 3D scatter plot was generated to visualize customer clusters based on their **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary** (RFM) values. This plot, created using matplotlib's 3D projection, maps Recency to the X-axis, Frequency to the Y-axis, and Monetary to the Z-axis. Each customer cluster is differentiated by color using the "Accent" colormap, allowing for a clear visual separation of segments across all three RFM dimensions. The axes are labeled and a grid is enabled to enhance readability, ultimately helping to validate the quality of the customer clustering.

```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 9), facecolor="#E6F9FA")   #Creates Matplotlib figure with a light background.
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d', label="bla")   #adds a 3D subplot to the figure.

######creates a 3D scatter plot of RFM data.
scatter = ax.scatter(
    RFM["Recency"], 
    RFM["Frequency"], 
    RFM["Monetary"], 
    c=RFM["Clusters"], 
    cmap="Accent", 
    s=60, 
    edgecolor='k', 
    alpha=0.8
) ######creates a 3D scatter plot of RFM data.

######Titles and labels the 3D plot axes.
ax.set_title("3D Clustering of Customers (RFM)", fontsize=16, fontweight='bold')
ax.set_xlabel("Recency", fontsize=12, fontweight='bold')
ax.set_ylabel("Frequency", fontsize=12, fontweight='bold')
ax.set_zlabel("Monetary", fontsize=12, fontweight='bold')
ax.grid(True)            #Titles and labels the 3D plot axes.

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
